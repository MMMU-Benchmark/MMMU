## Introduction
We introduce MMMU: a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal models on massive multi-discipline tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning. MMMU includes **11.5K meticulously collected multimodal questions** from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering. These questions span **30 subjects** and **183 subfields**, comprising **32 highly heterogeneous image types**, such as charts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, and chemical structures. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMMU focuses on advanced perception and reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, challenging models to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts. Our evaluation of 14 open-source LMMs and the proprietary GPT-4V(ision) highlights the substantial challenges posed by MMMU. Even the advanced GPT-4V only achieves a 56% accuracy, indicating significant room for improvement. We believe MMMU will stimulate the community to build next-generation multimodal foundation models towards expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

## Dataset Creation

MMMU was created to challenge multimodal models with tasks that demand college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning, pushing the boundaries of what these models can achieve in terms of expert-level perception and reasoning. Please refer to our huggingface [**ü§ó Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMMU/MMMU/) for more details.

## Evaluation
